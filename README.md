# hello-world
My first git repository

Hi there!

I've just created a branch off of my master file in hello-world.
I plan to use GitHub for teaching Python and Java. I hope it works
for the students!

The public link is: https://dunelandsue.github.io/hello-world/

Put files into the master, then link them in index.html
