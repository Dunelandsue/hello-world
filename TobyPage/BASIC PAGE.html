<H3> IT looks ugly </H3>
<B1> Notepad has to be one of the most <STRONG>dreadful</STRONG> things to look at in coding I have ever seen. The text size or the font just gives me the feeling that I am using a 20 year old program taht hasnt been updated since it was released. Also, the symbols that they use for the icons the the top of the sceen are barely decipherable </B1>

<H3> Its confusing</H3>
<B1> While most programming can be explained by going into each code and explaining what they mean. In Java, you can say that something like <EM>substatment</EM> is taking part of a sentence or <EM>while</EM> is saying to do an action while a condition it true. But in Notepad you just have random letter that could mean anything from indenting a line to inserting a picture. <BR> For example, if I wanted to make a &lt sign then I would have to input & then l then t. This is a problem because every time you want to remember how to do something simple you need to recall a set a letters and symbols.   </B1>

<H3> <TT>A third reason</TT> </H3>
<B1> <TT> The only thing thats more annoying then Notpad++ is probably when you need a third reason for something and you just can't think of it so you have to write something that is nothing related to what you were prevouisly talking about and just hope that noonne end up reading it. Yeah i'm talking to you. Your nosey aren't you? </TT>  </B1>

<OL> Why Java is better 
<LI> Interface
<UL>
<LI> Can make code look neater as it can be seperated into different classes.
<LI> Has better tools in that they are simple and usually uneeded so that it's not confusing.
<LI> The visuals are more appealing in java because almost everything is color coded as well as having, in my opinion, a sleeker looking text. 
</UL>
<LI> Code
<Ul>
<LI> Keywords are easy to understand. 
<LI> Takes some thinking as too how to get around a problem whilst Notepad is easy because it can't do math.
</UL>
<LI> Use
<UL>
<LI> Java can be used to solve very complex problems as well as program alot of technology whilst Notepad++ is only used to make websites. 
<LI> Java is one of the fastest growing program languages whilst Notepad++ is something I heard of last week.
